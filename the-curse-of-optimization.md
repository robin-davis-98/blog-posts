# The Curse of Optimization
`20/10/2024`

I have been thinking about optimization and why I think it is my greatest weakness as a programmer.

When we discuss optimization as programmers we often over look that this term has many meanings, especailly when non-programmers are in the mix. Optimization is a form of cleaning of the code - to make it run better - At least to non-programmers or early programmers, but optimization is actually a focusing of what you code needs to do, and this can appear in many forms. Do we focus on cycle times or speed of the running the code, what about file length or number of lines, what about structural optimization, what about complation? do we want a large complied file or small, do we want the build to be fast or slow? why do we want any of these things?

This is the question of optimization, and it is a trap. Kinda.

When I started learning to program I didn't know the first thing about optimization, I implimented structures poorly, I created monstruous control flow and all of the beginner mistakes of all programmers. But that time has gone and I feel I have gotten better at programming, and through that optimization has always been this white whale, a goal to strive for, structure or rule that I can follow. I think this is wrong.

Optimization shouldn't be something we strive for, at least not to begin with. Early optimization or preoptimization is the trap and one I have fallen for countless times.

This is because we waste time trying to structure code instead of creating the software in the first place. We fail to be programmers and instead architects to code that will never exist because we took to long to write a single line.

Is there an answer to this problem a way to avoid this trap, probably, but I have yet to find it. Perhaps I may never find the best way to avoid it. But I should just take the first step and write some code.
